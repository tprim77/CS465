CS 465 Full Stack Development


<b>Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). </b> 

Express HTML was used to handle the basic structure of the web pages, and set up paragraphs, links, and images. JavaScript was used mostly for the functionality of the overall application. It was used to define routes, controllers, and the main app itself. The SPA was used to load a single page designed only for an administrator to use and modify the website information. It has the ability to add, delete, and change information after the user logs in.

<b>Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?</b>

The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because the data was right for it. We were working on creating a MEAN stack which includes MongoDB and the data could be unstructed so NoSQL was a good choice.

<b>How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?</b>

JSON is mostly used to format data which can then be read by the code or the database in order to collect the information. JavaScript is its own programming language that has much more capability to code and display information. JSON ties together the frontend and backend by being the way for data to travel from one to the other and by making it simple for it to be gathered and displayed.

<b>Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.</b>

There were a few times that the code needed to be refactored in order to improve functionality and efficiencies. The code needed refactoring when adding some functionality, like when adding handlebars and other options. It reduced the redundancies in the code, which makes it much more efficient. Having reusable UI components makes it so it is consistent through the whole application and easy to maintain. It also makes it so developing or changing the UI is much more simple and modular in the future.

<b>Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.</b>

In a full stack application, methods are the functions implemented in both the frontend and backend that define the logic and behavior of the application. Endpoints are specific URLs on the server that correspond to distinct functionalities and normally can be associated with CRUD  operations. Security involves implementing authentication and authorization to protect data and control access to the site to ensure the safety of the application.

<b>How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?</b>

I have learned a ton in this course, and it has helped me to see how more of the pieces can all fit together to create an fully functional application. Before I had only worked with one or two components at a time, so working with multiple gave me a better view of all of the parts needed to get everything working as intended. Knowing more about full stack development will only increase my marketability in the career field, because I have a better understanding of one more area than I previously had.
